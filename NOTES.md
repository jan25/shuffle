- Output: New sorted list. 
- All elements input list are of same type.
- Critieria grouping function expect a element of type T to return a primitive value that identifies elements logical group.

# Ideas

- Support recursive grouping and shuffling.
- Implement library in different languages under subdirectories
- Implement UI to visualize shuffling.
